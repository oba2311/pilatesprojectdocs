# Trainee Data Structure Fix - January 2024

## Issue Description

Two issues were identified in the trainee data structure:

1. An invalid test document with ID "1" was present in the trainees collection
2. Some trainee documents had `nextSession` objects with `null` categories instead of a proper categories object

## Technical Details

### Issue 1: Invalid Test Document

- Document ID: "1"
- Problem: Missing required fields (`id`, `firstName`, `lastName`)
- Resolution: Document was deleted as it was determined to be a test/invalid entry

### Issue 2: Invalid nextSession Structure

- Affected documents had `nextSession.categories: null`
- Required structure:

```typescript
nextSession: {
  categories: {
    [category: string]: string  // category -> exercise mapping
  },
  comments: string
}
```

## Implementation

1. Fixed Firestore emulator port configuration from 8080 to 8081
2. Used proper collection naming with business ID prefix via `COLLECTIONS` constant
3. Updated affected documents to have proper `nextSession.categories` structure

### Code Changes

```typescript
// Firebase config update
db.settings({
	host: "localhost:8081", // Updated from 8080
	ssl: false,
});

// Data structure fix
await traineeRef.update({
	"nextSession.categories": {
		"Warm Up": "Buso",
		Spinal: "Tower",
	},
});
```

## Verification

- Ran verification system to confirm data structure integrity
- All checks passed after fixes
- Verified through Firestore Emulator UI

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Added stricter validation in the verification system
2. Using proper collection prefixes via `COLLECTIONS` constant
3. Maintaining correct emulator configuration
